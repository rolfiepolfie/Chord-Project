## IDEAS
## - make an function for delaying the root-change for the chord - ok
##    
## - tempo tap functionality 
## - make an add 7 function
## 
## - make an convert to minor function (always 3ed note in a chord?)
##
## - realized that FCB1010 = not polyfonic 
# strategy1
### 1. chord knob is pressed    
### 2. chord is copied to global 
### 3. bass note is pressed
### 4. chord in global is played once
### 5. reset flag so no new chord is trigged

# NB! scb fires CC control:0 ch:0 val:36 accidentaly
# we therefore avoid control=0
#sus 2 + 7 = 9 
#    having an add 7 function can simplify

### NEW CONTROLS
# convert to minor
# add7
# add6 or flat the 7th
# add 2
# add 9
# sharpen 7
# flat 7    (maj) 

### fcb chords
#### C_maj,   C_aug,  Cdim,   ,C6,      C9
#### C_major, C_sus2, C_minor, C7_minor, C7

# I need control that plays fex: dm7 when playing G (slash chord)


# the 12 step pedal board has velocity and tilt sensitive and pressure control
# this can be used to add extra parameters ... like assign a chord root in "silent mode"

# chord sequence mode ... [C,F,G] lpp trough them with a pedal for fast songs ..


### NEXT UP: make a panic button and a keyboard interceptor
### maybe sending panic message by a CC value message



mido.ports.multi_receive(ports, yield_ports=False, block=True)
Receive messages from multiple ports.

Generates messages from ever input port. The ports are polled in random order for fairness, 
and all messages from each port are yielded before moving on to the next port.

If yield_ports=True, (port, message) is yielded instead of just the message.

If block=False only pending messages will be yielded.

#### IDEA : make a system based on the Stradella system by stacking harmonies 
# or any other system, the app must detect several knobs at the same time ...

tip: Since many jazz chords are actually "stacked" triads, 
one can often play them using two buttons

What is major 3rd and minor 3rd?
A minor interval has one less semitone than a major interval. 
For example: since 
C to E is a major third (4 half steps), 
C to Eb is a minor third (3 half steps). 


In this case, the ports are device ports, and are connected to some sort of (physical or virtual) MIDI device, but a port can be anything. For example, you can use a MultiPort receive messages from multiple ports as if they were one:

from mido.ports import MultiPort

...
multi = MultiPort([inport1, inport2, inport3])
for msg in multi:
    print(msg)


#### make arpegiator ...
